Math & Vectors
============

Code bundle focusing on vector math related problems such as intersection, collision, perpendicular points and similar topics.
Most of these examples were written by yours truly in response to questions on the [Processing forum](https://forum.processing.org/).

####ClosestPointToLine
PVector-based. Find the closest point on line AB to point P.

####IntersectionLineCircle
PVector-based. Find the point(s) of intersection (if any) between a line and a circle. Not only IF they intersect, but also WHERE.

####Line2TriangleMesh
Toxiclibs-based. Turn a series of points (aka a line) into a triangle mesh.

####LineNormal
PVector-based. Find the normal of a line between point A and B (aka two perpendicular lines).

####RectanglesOutline
PVector-based. Find the outer perimeter (outline) of two intersecting rectangles.

####RectanglesOverlap
PVector-based. Find the overlapping area of two intersecting rectangles.
