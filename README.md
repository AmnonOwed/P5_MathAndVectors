Math & Vectors
============

Code bundle focusing on vector math related problems such as intersection, collision, perpendicular points and similar topics.
Most of these examples were written by yours truly in response to questions on the [Processing forum](https://forum.processing.org/).

####IntersectionLineCircle
PVector-based. Find the point(s) of intersection (if any) between a line and a circle. Not only IF they intersect, but also WHERE.

####ClosestPointToLine
